<h1>Welcome!</h1>

<p>Here's how to use our voice broadcasting platform. If you ever get lost and need to find your way back here, just click "Help" in the upper right corner.</p>

<h2>Scripts</h2>

<p>This is where you upload your recordings and, if your recordings survey people using keypad buttons ("Press 1 if you like chocolate, 2 if you like strawberry..."), set up the responses.</p> 
 
<h2>Campaigns</h2> 
 
<p>First, set up a couple small things: choose the outgoing caller ID (the number that's displayed when you call somebody) and choose your script. Then upload your lists of phone numbers to call. If you want to add more numbers to the campaign, you can upload another list even while the campaign is running.</p> 

<h2>Control</h2>

<p>Here you can start and stop your campaigns, as well as see live how many numbers have been called and how many are left.</p>

<h2>Reports</h2>
<p>After you finish making calls, see how many minutes you've used and download a spreadsheet of all the calls that have been made.</p>
