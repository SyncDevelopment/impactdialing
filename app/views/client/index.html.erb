<h1>Welcome!</h1>

<p>Here's how to use our predictive dialer. If you ever get lost and need to find your way back here, just click "Help" in the upper right corner. <a href="/caller">Your callers can log in here.</a></p>

<h2>Callers</h2>

<p>If you&#8217;re running a call center, you may want to give each of your callers a login, so that you can track their performance individually. Or you can use shared logins; for example, a political campaign could give each of its offices a login, and compete to see who can make the most calls.</p>

<h2>Scripts</h2>

<p>This is where you create the script that callers see on their screen, choose what information is displayed when someone picks up, and set up the possible call results.</p> 
 
<h2>Campaigns</h2> 
 
<p>First, set up a couple small things: choose the outgoing caller ID (the number that's displayed when you call somebody), choose your script and dialing mode, and optionally upload a voicemail message. Next, choose which callers have access. Finally, upload the list of phone numbers to call; if you want to add more numbers to the campaign, you can upload another list even while people are calling.</p> 

<h2>Monitor</h2>

<p>While your callers are logged in, you can monitor who is on the system with the Monitor tab. Your callers can log in <a href="/caller">here</a>, or for phones-only, call into the call-in number, and enter their PIN and the Campaign ID. If you'd like a local area code call-in number, contact us and we'll set one up for you.</p>

<h2>Reports</h2>
<p>Here, you can see statistics for each campaign and each caller you've set up, and download the call results.</p>
