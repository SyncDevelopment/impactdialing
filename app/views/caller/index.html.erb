<h2>Getting started</h2>

<p>First, choose your campaign above and click Go.</p>

<p>You'll see a preview of your script. When you're ready to start, enter your phone number and click Start Taking Calls. Impact Dialing will call you.</p>

<p>Start talking when the hold music ends - you often won't hear the "hello". Information about the person who answered will pop up above the script, and your call result options will appear below. If an answering machine slips through or you need to hang up on someone, click the End Call button. After you fill out your Call Results, either choose Submit and Continue Taking Calls or Submit and Stop Taking Calls.</p>

<p>When you stop, youâ€™ll be returned to the script preview screen. If you want to switch campaigns, click Home in the upper right corner to come back to this screen.</p>

<h2>Supported browsers</h2>
<p>Impact Dialing works best in <a href="http://www.google.com/chrome/">Google Chrome</a> and <a href="http://www.apple.com/safari/">Apple Safari</a> versions 5 or higher.</p>
<p>We also support lower versions of Chrome and Safari, as well as all versions of Firefox, and Internet Explorer versions 6 and higher. You must have Flash installed for these browsers to work.</p>
<p>Avast Antivirus users: You must disable Avast's Web Shield, as it has a bug that prevents Impact Dialing from working properly. You might consider <a href="http://support.avast.com/">contacting Avast</a> to ask that they fix the bug blocking WebSocket traffic.</p>
