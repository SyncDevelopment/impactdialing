Oh no! We were unable to renew your subscription. Most likely this is because the card we have on file being declined.

Please login and update the payment info for your account.

We will retry again in 3 days. If that fails we will try 5 days after that. If that fails we will try 7 days after that. If all 3 attempts fail the subscription will be cancelled.

In short, if payment is not received in 15 days the subscription will be cancelled.

As of right now the subscription is unpaid and so callers will not be able to dial.

Don't hesitate to get a hold of us at <%= SUPPORT_EMAIL %> with any questions or concerns.
