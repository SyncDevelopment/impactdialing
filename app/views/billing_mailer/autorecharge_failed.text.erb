Oh no! We tried and failed to automatically purchase <%= @minutes_attempted %> minutes for your account. Most likely this is because the card we have on file being declined.

This automatic attempt was made because the autorecharge settings on your account are set to purchase <%= @minutes_attempted %> for <%= number_to_currency(@amount) %> when your account has less than <%= @trigger %> minutes remaining.

Autorecharge is now disabled. Please login to update the payment info and re-enable autorecharge or manually add funds.

Your account currently has <%= 'minute'.pluralize(@minutes_available) %> remaining. When these reach zero then callers will not be able to dial.

Don't hesitate to get a hold of us at <%= SUPPORT_EMAIL %> with any questions or concerns.
