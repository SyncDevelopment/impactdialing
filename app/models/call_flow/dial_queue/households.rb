##
# Maintains a set of hashes where the redis-key & hash-key are components of 
# a phone number and the values are JSON strings of an array of ids.
#
# For example, given a phone number 5554443321, member id of 42
# and a campaign id of 4323, the corresponding redis key will be
# `dial_queue:42:households:55544` which accesses a redis hash.
# The corresponding hash key will be `43321` which will return
# a JSON string of an array of ids.
#
# The key partitioning scheme uses the first 5 digits of the number
# as a component to the redis key and the remaining digits of the number
# as the component to the hash key. Some numbers may have more digits than
# others, eg if they include a country code. Currently no attempt is made
# to normalize phone numbers across country codes. For example if the number
# `5554443321` is added and then `15554443321` is added, they will define
# different households.
