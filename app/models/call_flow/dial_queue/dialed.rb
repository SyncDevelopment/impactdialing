##
# Class for caching list of dialed voters.
# This list is not seeded until a voter is ready to call.
# Once a voter has been added to this list. The voter should
# remain on the list until the associated campaign's recycle rate expires.
#
# When deploying this, it's possible there could be some campaign's with long recycle
# rates (eg 24 hours). So once these changes are deployed to production, make sure
# to run a script to seed the dialed lists for these campaigns to avoid potentially long
# start-up times in the morning as well as to avoid calling household members. Check
# w/ Michael to see if there's any value in this seed'ing first.
